# perfmonNodePortal
A quick and dirty way to get PerfMon counter info from a windows box using node.  

The aims o this project is to be able to install a quick way to monitor a windows box using Perf Mon counters.
The aims of this project:

- An easy way to monitor a windows box remotely using PerfMon counters. 
- Should be fairly light with no dependencies on IIS and other windows tech (excluding PerfMon of course) shouldn't distort the results too much. 
- Should be quick to install and get running with minimal config changes on production boxes. 

That said I just started so there isn't that much here yet.
